## Milestone 2

For our second milestone, after doing some rough development from milestone 1, we were able to have a better vision of the gameplay. Therefore, we made some changes to the game mechanics.

(describe the new concept here with 1 conveyor belt and the shutters)

### First mockup of the shop screen (Carol):

- Implemented the customer spawner where a new customer will spawn in every 5 seconds, unless there are already 3 customers at the counter. They also each have a timer that dictates how long they will stay at the counter before being upset and leaving.

- Customer orders have boba colors
