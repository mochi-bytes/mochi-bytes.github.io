In "Fishy Tea," players step into the paws of a heroic feline on a mission to rescue a boba shop from disaster. When the clumsy owner accidentally spills fish into the boba machine, the fish get packed into cups, unbeknownst to anyone. As the cat, players must use a straw to poke holes in the cups on conveyor belts and suck up the fish before they reach customers. With quick reflexes and strategic moves, players must prevent a fishy fiasco and save the shop's reputation. With humor and charm, "Fishy Tea" offers addictive gameplay for all ages.

- Boba cups spawn from two locations: On the top and bottom of the screen. They move in opposite directions to add to the hecticness and increase the panic for the player
- The player can drag the cat to one of the boba cups. The boba cups have a visual indication that they are the one that the player is interacting with. In the future, when the player lets go of the cat on a boba cup, it will transition to the cup screen above.
