# Fishy Tea

## Overview

In "Fishy Tea," players step into the paws of a heroic feline on a mission to rescue a boba shop from disaster. When the clumsy owner accidentally spills fish into the boba machine, the fish get packed into cups, unbeknownst to anyone. As the cat, players must use a straw to poke holes in the cups on conveyor belts and suck up the fish before they reach customers. With quick reflexes and strategic moves, players must prevent a fishy fiasco and save the shop's reputation. With humor and charm, "Fishy Tea" offers addictive gameplay for all ages.

- This is the gameplay screen where the player will have to pick out fish from the boba cup. This shows the first steps in randomly generating the boba and fish for variability.
- Proper measures were taken so that the boba and fish don't fully overlap and there is enough to fill the intended space.
- Text indicator in the top left corner of how many fish were randomly spawned so the player knows how many they need to find.

### First mockup of the shop screen (Carol):

- Boba cups spawn from two locations: On the top and bottom of the screen. They move in opposite directions to add to the hecticness and increase the panic for the player
- The player can drag the cat to one of the boba cups. The boba cups have a visual indication that they are the one that the player is interacting with. In the future, when the player lets go of the cat on a boba cup, it will transition to the cup screen above.
