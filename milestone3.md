### Kailee:

- Added the score system and made sure it was visible between scenes
- Made sure that customer orders and timer persisted between scenes and didn't restart spawning on top of the old ones

### Carol:
- Drew and animated the cat 
- Added background music that muffles when the player enters the cup screen.
- Added other additional sound effects: Customers making angry noises when they receive the wrong order or don't receive an order in time, having a cash register sound when successfully completing a customer's order, and the slurping sound effect when sucking up a fish
- Implemented customer order success, verifying that you brought the correct order to the customer and awards points accordingly

### Kristyn:

- Implemented the trash can functionality to the game. Players can drag a boba drink from the table to the trash can and it will be thrown away. The free space can be filled with a new boba drink.
- Created 2 new boba assets. One without a straw and with a straw. New colors were choosen to reflect reaslistic boba colors.
- Implemented the logic for the shutter. When pressing the button on the counter, the shutter will go up and down. When the shutter is down, the player is unable to go to the cupscene. The shutter stays up or down between scenes.
- Made a table asset and fixed a bug with the completed boba layering
